Abstract classes

1) Can contain both abstract and concrete (normal) methods.

2) Can have instance variables, static variables, and final variables.

3) Can have constructors, which are invoked during subclass object creation to initialize state.

4) Supports partial abstraction.

5) A class can extend only one abstract class.

6) Methods can have any access modifier (public, protected, package-private).

7)Used when classes are closely related and share common state or behavior.

8) abstract methods cannot be static
Interfaces

1) Supports full abstraction (before Java 8); partial abstraction after Java 8.

2) Can have:

    abstract methods

    default methods

    static methods

3) Cannot have constructors because:

    No instance variables

    Does not participate in object creation

    Variables are implicitly public static final (constants).

4) A class can implement multiple interfaces (supports multiple inheritance).

    Methods are implicitly public.

5) Used to define capabilities / contracts and enable loose coupling.
