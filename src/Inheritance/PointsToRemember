Parent p = new Child();

1) Always the right hand side object will be called but the reference 'p' will decide what members are accessible at compile time.
2) Parent constructor is always executed first followed by child constructor.
3) If both parent and child class have same method (overriding) then always the method of the object which is created is called.

for example

Parent has shout() method and child has shout() method and if you do like Parent p = new Child() then always the method of child will be called.



**Golden rule ***

“In Java, variables and static methods are resolved using the reference type,
while overridden instance methods are executed based on the actual object type at runtime.”

Interfaces

1) interfaces can have only static final meaning by defult the variables are static and final

2) interfaces cannot be instantiated hence we cannot create constructors for interfaces
